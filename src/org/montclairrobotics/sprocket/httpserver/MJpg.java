/**
 * A basic implementation of a MJPG streamer as a Java servlet. MJPG is commonly used to deliver 
 * image information from networked cameras via an HTTP stream. The set up of this class allws 
 * for dynamic image information that is created in real time to be sent to any tool capable of 
 * reading MJPG including several major internet browsers (Safari, Chrome, and Firefox).
 * 
 * We exclude four necessary images, which can be places in the user's home directory. We name
 * our revolving images 'winter', 'spring', 'summer', and 'fall'. Images can be of any type, but
 * this class is set up to read JPG images. Altering the image source type involves changing
 * the ImageIO.write() function call that returns the image as a byte array.
 * 
 * The byte array could also be loaded live and not generated from a static file.
 * 
 * Feedback may be sent to josh dot dickson at wpi dot edu.
