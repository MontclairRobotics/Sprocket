/**
 * DriveModule is a class that extends Motor which provides additional behaviors

 * they provide force, where they are relative to the robot's geometrical center,
 * and it's maximum size. This information makes drive train calculations easier
 * without needing to have the developer enter Motors in any specific order, while
 * also making generic power mappers possible.
